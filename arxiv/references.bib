	abstract = { The probability of winning a simple game of competing Poisson processes turns out to be equal to the well-known Bessel function integral \$J(x,y)\$ (cf. Y. L. Luke, Integrals of Bessel Functions, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1962). Several properties of J, some of which seem to be new, follow quite easily from this probabilistic interpretation. The results are applied to the random telegraph process as considered by Kac [Rocky Mountain J. Math., 4 (1974), pp. 497--509]. },

@article{NeumannSSR,
	abstract = {The processing and manipulation of quantum information holds great promise in terms of outperforming classical computers and secure communication. However, quantum information is delicate, and even reading the information is a destructive and probabilistic process requiring a number of measurements to home in on the information stored as a quantum state. For the nitrogen vacancy in diamond, Neumann et al. (p. 542, published online 1 July) show that these limitations can be eliminated. A measurement protocol was designed and implemented where the spin state of the nuclear spin of the vacancy could be mapped onto and read out from the surrounding electronic spins in a single-shot measurement nondestructively. The quantum state of a single nitrogen vacancy in diamond can be read out nondestructively in a single-shot measurement. Projective measurement of single electron and nuclear spins has evolved from a gedanken experiment to a problem relevant for applications in atomic-scale technologies like quantum computing. Although several approaches allow for detection of a spin of single atoms and molecules, multiple repetitions of the experiment that are usually required for achieving a detectable signal obscure the intrinsic quantum nature of the spin's behavior. We demonstrated single-shot, projective measurement of a single nuclear spin in diamond using a quantum nondemolition measurement scheme, which allows real-time observation of an individual nuclear spin's state in a room-temperature solid. Such an ideal measurement is crucial for realization of, for example, quantum error correction protocols in a quantum register.},
